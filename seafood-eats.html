topic1-title: What are the global goals?
topic1-text: The Global Goals were formed by world leaders who have come together and decided upon 17 goals that will help better our world by 2030. The specific goal that was chosen for this application is known as “Life Below Water”. Within this goal, there were many targets that the world needed to achieve, in order to complete the goal. One of the targets Seafood Eats aims to assist in, is to “sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans.”

problem: The Problem
problem-text: 70 percent of our world is cover with oceans, lakes, rivers, and seas, yet daily we often forget how much pressure we place on it. Right now, our oceans are undergoing a major habitat loss. Humans are making it more difficult for our oceans to supply our exponential needs. Since the ocean’s coastal areas are so closely involved with the human population, it suffers more deeply, mainly as a result of manmade environmental degradation. Urban professionals are in need of a way to locate restaurants that serve sustainable seafood because they are unaware of the ecological abuse that producers and consumers are contributing to our waters.
