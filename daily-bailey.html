problem: The Problem
problem-text: Currently, dog owners are living with the concern of not knowing the up-to-date health condition of their best friend. Many people can’t afford to go to a veterinarian more than a couple of times a year. While dogs show signs of discomfort and distress, it is very difficult to know about their internal issues such as diseases or more severe conditions. Dog owners are in need of a way to monitor their dog’s daily activity because their dog is a part of their family and they need to be taken care of.

solution: The Solution
solution-text: Daily Bailey will allow dog owners access to their dog’s health behaviors. This app will be linked to a dog collar that can monitor the dogs; temperature, pulse, respiration and sleep. It will also give dog owners a simple way to set dates and send emails to their veterinarian about any concerns.
