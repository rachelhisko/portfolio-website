main-title: Daily Bailey
main-caption: Smart Product Prototype
problem: The Problem
problem-text: Currently dog owners are living with the concern of not knowing if their best friend is healthy. Mostly because they see the veterinarian once or twice a year and their dogs are unable to express signs of discomfort or diseases, like humans can.

solution: The Solution
solution-text: Daily Bailey will allow dog owners access to their dog’s health behaviours. This app will be linked to a dog collar that can monitor the dogs; temperature, pulse, respiration and sleep. It will also give dog owners a simple way to set dates and send emails to their veterinarian about any concerns. Dog owners are in need of a way to monitor their dog’s daily activity because their dog is a part of their family and they need to be taken care of.
