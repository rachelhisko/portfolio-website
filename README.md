I am a Graphic Designer with a passion towards human-centered designs. I primarily focus on innovative concepts regarding the User Interface and the User Experience (UI/UX).

I am an out of the box thinking, always challenging myself to consider alternative perspectives, other than my own. By contemplating various viewpoints, it will help me realize unique ideas that may make significant change in the world.

I believe that I was put on this earth for a reason, to use my skills as an inspired designer to develop an app-based interface that may have a positive impact on people. I want to design interfaces that will assist people to live a balanced life, while helping to create a more sustainable world. Sustainability is the foundation of my work; by always trying to provide alternative methods to simplify our global and individual dilemmas.
