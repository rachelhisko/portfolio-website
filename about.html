    <h3 class="underline push-1-2">My UX/UI Process</h3>
    <h5 itemprop="name" class="push-1-4 bold">Research</h5>
    <div class="push">
      <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0">Step 1 – Empathy</p>
      <p itemprop="name" class="milli push-1-4">To begin my UX research I would conduct 5 interviews with user group. Then after, I would curate all of my data into a coding chart, where I would list all the answers and group common responses. To help me define the problem I generated an empathy map populated by my previous research. After I discovered the needs and insights that all the users had in common.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="push">
      <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0">Step 2 – Problem</p>
      <p itemprop="name" class="milli push-1-4">From here I would create a problem statement to identify the users’ need. After discovering the problem, I would then quickly create eight solutions, and narrow them down to four. After receiving feedback, I then would create one seamless solution for the problem.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="push">
      <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0">Step 3 – Defining the application</p>
      <p itemprop="name" class="milli">Finally, I am able to define the app with a app definition statement. Later, I would then create user stories, these stories are how the user will flow through and use the app.</p>
    </div>
    <h5 itemprop="name" class="bold">Prototyping</p>
    <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0">Step 4 – Epics and User Stories</p>
    <p itemprop="name" class=" milli">The first step in my process are creating epics are high level objectives that could span over multiple sprints and user stories define the feature of the application that tend to only span over one sprint. I like to think of my app definition statement as the epic. I would create a bubble chart with the epic as the main focus and then user stories would fall underneath. After I have created all the possible user stories, I would group and saturate them into categories between features. (links back to step 4) From here I would begin sketching specific flows.</p>
    <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0">Step 5 – Flow</p>
    <p itemprop="name" class="milli">The second step in my prototyping process is creating a flow, this is to help me map out what the main features are going to be within the application. I would create a f low for each task because each task as a unique flow.</p>
    <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0">Step 6 – Sketching Paper Wireframes</p>
    <p itemprop="name" class="milli">Sketching is a step that I spend a lot of time doing. I work everything out before I even think about bringing them to life. I would start with the first task and proceed from there sketching every step that would help the user finish the task with ease.</p>
    <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0">Step 7 – Low Fidelity Wireframes</p>
    <p itemprop="name" class="milli">I create low fidelity wireframes by literally taking exactly what I sketched on paper and bringing them to life with grey box and fake text. I do this so I can quickly bring it on to the computer to see sizing and layout. After creating the low fidelity wireframes, I would link everything in XD. This is so I can see how to flow of the application works, I would also get a couple users to test it out to make sure everything is accessible and easy to use.</p>
    <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0">Step 8 – Accessibility Revisions</p>
    <p itemprop="name" class="push-1-4 milli">This step I would go back and rework anything that was not working during the user testing.</p>
    <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0">Step 9 – High Fidelity Prototype</p>
    <p itemprop="name" class="milli">Here is where I would start plugging in the visual design, adding pictures, real text, colors, etc. I would also add all the pages that need to be created such as (pop-up menus, forms) After finishing the visual design, I would link everything and proceed with user testing. User testing is the most important aspect to my process because it really helps proves if the application is accessible for the user group.</p>
    <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0">Step 10 – Design Revisions</p>
    <p itemprop="name" class="milli">After completing the usability testing I would go back to my design and rework anything that was not user friendly. I would also fix some visual design aspect if need be.</p>
