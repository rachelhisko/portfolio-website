        <p itemprop="description" class="main-text push-1-2 milli">Hi there, I’m Rachel! You can usually find me touring around my hometown of Carleton Place, Ontario; taking photos, drinking Salted Carmel Mochas and listening to classical music.</p>
        <p itemprop="description" class="main-text push-1-2 milli">I am a Graphic Designer with a passion towards human-centred designs. I primarily focus on innovative concepts regarding <strong>User Interface and User Experience Design (UI/UX).</strong></p>
        <p itemprop="description" class="main-text push-1-2 milli">I am an out of the box thinker, always challenging myself to consider alternative perspectives, other than my own. By contemplating various viewpoints, it will help me realize unique ideas that may make significant change in the world.</p>

    <h3 class="underline push-1-2">Why do I do what I do?</h3>
    <div class="">
      <p itemprop="description" class="main-text push-1-2 milli">The question 'why?' is one of the single most basic questions, and one that we have asked since we first learned to talk. Why this? Why that? After a lot of self-discovery as a designer and as a person, I think I have found the answer to my hardest ‘why’ question, 'Why do I do, what I do?''</p>
      <p itemprop="description" class="main-text push-1-2 milli">I am a user experience / user interface designer, fresh out of college. I don’t design just any type of user interface though. My passion is designing interfaces that will make an impact on people lives. I enjoy encouraging stories within others, and asking them, 'why?' ‘Why’ is my favourite question, as it helps bring out meaning and context to basic information. I want to help others through user interface and user experience design. That is my ‘why’.</p>

    <h3 class="underline push-1-2">My UX/UI Process</h3>
    <h5 itemprop="name" class="push-1-4 bold">Research</h5>
    <div class="push">
      <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0 bold">Step 1 – Empathy</p>
      <p itemprop="name" class="milli push-1-4">To begin my UX research, I would conduct 5 interviews with the user group. Then, I would curate all of my data into a coding chart, where I would list all the questions and group common responses. To help me define the problem, I would generate an empathy map populated by my previous research. My finding will then help me understand the needs and insights that all the users had in common.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="push">
      <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0 bold">Step 2 – Problem</p>
      <p itemprop="name" class="milli push-1-4">From here I would create a problem statement to identify the users’ need. After discovering the problem, I would then quickly create eight solutions, and narrow them down to four. After receiving feedback, I would then create one, seamless solution for the problem.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="push">
      <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0 bold">Step 3 – Defining the application</p>
      <p itemprop="name" class="milli">After creating the solution to the problem faced by users, I would then create a concise statement that represents the main purpose of the app – this is known as the app definition statement.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="push-1-2 pad-t">

    <h5 itemprop="name" class="bold">Prototyping</p>
    <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0 bold">Step 4 – Epics and User Stories</p>
    <p itemprop="name" class=" milli">The first step in my prototyping process is to create epics and user stories. Epics are high level objectives that could span over multiple sprints. User stories define the feature of the application that tends to only span over one sprint. I like to think of my app definition statement as the epic. I would create a bubble chart with the epic as the main focus and then user stories would fall underneath. After I have created all the possible user stories, I would group and saturate them into categories between features. From here I would begin sketching specific flows.</p>
    <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0 bold">Step 5 – Flow</p>
    <p itemprop="name" class="milli">The second step in my prototyping process is creating a flow chart; this is to help me map out what the main features are going to be within the application.</p>
    <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0 bold">Step 6 – Sketching Paper Wireframes</p>
    <p itemprop="name" class="milli">Sketching is a step that I spend a lot of time doing. I work everything out before I even think about starting the designs on the computer. I would start with the first task and proceed from there, sketching every step that would help the user finish the task with ease.</p>
    <div class="push-1-2">
      <img class="img-flex" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/about-image-2.jpg" alt="Self Portrait">
    </div>
    <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0 bold">Step 7 – Low Fidelity Wireframes</p>
    <p itemprop="name" class="milli">I create low fidelity wireframes by literally taking exactly what I sketched on paper and designing a digital version of it on the computer. I do this so I can quickly bring it onto the computer to see sizing and layout. After creating the low fidelity wireframes, I would link everything in XD and see how the flow of the application works. I would then get a couple users to test it out to make sure everything is accessible and easy to use.</p>
    <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0 bold">Step 8 – Accessibility Revisions</p>
    <p itemprop="name" class="push-1-4 milli">This step is about going back and reworking anything that was not working during the user testing.</p>
    <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0 bold">Step 9 – High Fidelity Prototype</p>
    <p itemprop="name" class="milli">Here is where I would start plugging in the visual design, adding pictures, real text, colors, etc. I would also add all the pages that need to be created, such as pop-up menus, and forms. After finishing the visual design, I would link everything and proceed with another user test. User testing is the most important aspect to my process because it really helps proves if the application is accessible for the user group.</p>
    <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0 bold">Step 10 – Design Revisions</p>
    <p itemprop="name" class="milli">After completing the usability testing, I would go back to my design and rework anything that was not user friendly. I would also fix any visual design aspects that need adjusting.</p>
