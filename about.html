      <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0">Step 1 – Empathy</p>
      <p itemprop="name" class="milli push-1-4">To begin my UX research I would conduct 5 interviews with user group. Then after, I would curate all of my data into a coding chart, where I would list all the answers and group common responses. To help me define the problem I generated an empathy map populated by my previous research. After I discovered the needs and insights that all the users had in common.</p>

    <div class="push">
      <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0">Step 2 – Problem</p>
      <p itemprop="name" class="milli push-1-4">From here I would create a problem statement to identify the users’ need. After discovering the problem, I would then quickly create eight solutions, and narrow them down to four. After receiving feedback, I then would create one seamless solution for the problem.</p>

    <div class="push">
      <p itemprop="description" class="milli push-0">Step 3 – Defining the application</p>
      <p itemprop="name" class="milli">Finally, I am able to define the app with a app definition statement. Later, I would then create user stories, these stories are how the user will flow through and use the app.</p>
