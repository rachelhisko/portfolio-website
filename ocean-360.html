problem-text: Traditionally scuba divers are able to take underwater photos with an underwater camera or Go Pro. Although they have to go through the process of upload the photos to your computer and carrying around lots of heavy equipment. Scuba divers are in need of a more productive way to capture breathtaking photography and share it with the world.
